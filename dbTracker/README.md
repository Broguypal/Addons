## ✨ Features

- **Debuff Tracking**  
  Monitors and displays active debuffs on each party member in real-time, including your own character.  

- **Role-Based Job Coloring**  
  Jobs are automatically colored by their role for quick identification:  
  - **Tank** – Blue  
  - **Healer** – Green  
  - **Pure DD** – Brown  
  - **Hybrid** – Orange  
  - **Magic DPS** – Dark Purple  
  - **Support** – Yellow  

- **Severe Debuffs Highlighting**  
  Debuffs flagged as **SEVERE** in `tracked_buffs.lua` are displayed in **red**, making them stand out as urgent.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Place the `dbTracker` folder into your Windower `addons` directory.  
2. Inside Windower, load the addon with:  
   ```
   //lua load dbTracker
   ```

## 📖 Usage

- The addon runs automatically once loaded.  
- The overlay displays party slots, names, active debuffs, and role-colored jobs.  
- Drag the header ("dbTracker") to reposition the window.  
- Your own job is detected and colored immediately on load.

## 🔶 Severe Debuffs

- Certain debuffs are marked as **SEVERE** (configured in `tracked_buffs.lua`).  
- When a party member has one of these active, their debuff list will be highlighted in **orange**.  
- This makes it easy to spot critical statuses that require urgent attention (e.g., **Doom**, **Charm**, or other high-priority effects).  

---

## 📝 Notes

- This addon parses incoming packets to maintain accurate debuff states.  
- Zone changes reset tracking to prevent stale data.  
- Only tracked debuffs defined in `tracked_buffs.lua` are shown.
